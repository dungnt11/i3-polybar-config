Create an executable file containing the startup logic, for example $HOME/.config/polybar/launch.sh:
```bash
  #!/usr/bin/env bash

  # Terminate already running bar instances
  killall -q polybar
  # If all your bars have ipc enabled, you can also use 
  # polybar-msg cmd quit

  # Launch bar1 and bar2
  echo "---" | tee -a /tmp/polybar1.log /tmp/polybar2.log
  polybar bar1 >>/tmp/polybar1.log 2>&1 & disown
  polybar bar2 >>/tmp/polybar2.log 2>&1 & disown

  echo "Bars launched..."
```

Make it executable:
```bash
  $ chmod +x $HOME/.config/polybar/launch.sh
```

If you are using i3, add the following lines to your configuration:
```bash
  // i3/config
  exec_always --no-startup-id $HOME/.config/polybar/launch.sh
```

and remove these

bar {
    i3bar_command i3bar
}

The first line executes the startup script; the second disables i3's default bar
